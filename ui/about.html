        hours a week at the office and have less than 60 minutes to consume lunch. 
        They are multi-cultural and many need to know whether the food complies 
        with their diet. Many more suffer from food allergies and find it difficult to 
        know if the food contains allergens that affect them. Furthermore, specialised 
        diners that serve them are out of reach by price and distance.
